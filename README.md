This repository contains 4 Level 2 internship projects: a Calculator App, Tribute Page, Basic To-Do List App, and a Login Authentication System.

Level 1: CALCULATOR
This project is a fully functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The calculator features an interactive interface with a display screen that shows both user input and the calculated result. The layout is designed using CSS Grid to ensure proper alignment and spacing of buttons, closely resembling a real-world calculator.
This project demonstrates foundational front-end skills and logic building required to create interactive web applications.

Level 2: LOGIN AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM
This project is a simple yet effective Login Authentication System created using HTML, Tailwind CSS, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables users to register with their credentials, log in securely, and access a protected dashboard page. The application provides a clean and modern user interface with intuitive navigation between Sign Up, Login, and Dashboard pages.
Key Features:
User Registration: Allows users to create a new account using their email, username, and password.
Login Verification: Validates user credentials and grants access only if the input matches the registered data.
Secure Dashboard Access: After a successful login, users are redirected to a dashboard with a fixed navigation header.
Logout Functionality: Users can log out, which clears session data and redirects them back to the login page.
This project highlights essential front-end development concepts like DOM manipulation, form validation, and local data handling, making it a solid foundation for building more advanced user authentication systems.

LEVEL 3: A BASIC TO-DO WEBAPP
This project is a simple yet functional To-Do List web application developed using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their daily tasks with ease by offering essential features like adding, editing, marking complete, and deleting tasks.
Key Features:
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks which are immediately displayed in the list.
Mark as Complete: Completed tasks are moved to a dedicated Completed Tasks section.
Pending Tasks: Tasks that are yet to be completed are listed separately under Pending Tasks.
Edit/Delete: Users can update or remove any task from either list.
Time Stamps (optional enhancement): You can include the date and time a task was added or marked as completed for better tracking.
